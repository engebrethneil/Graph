Next, on January 1st 2018 there was no rain and was marked at 0. Finally, on January 1st 2019 the graph shows a spike as 0.88 Inches of rain were recorded in State College.  Overall January 1st at this time have an influx of rain showing either to be very high or none at all. We can make that inference by using the graph above. "
